CovexHull

A new algorithm and implementation of
1. Convex Hull problem
2. Line drawing algorithm

The C++ code is simple to read and understand. The complexity is O(N) when the points are sorted by one coordinate. 
This console app opens an image file, draws the convex hull and creates an output image file. 

The command line parameters:
ConvexHullConsole.exe <IMAGE_FILE> -o <OUTPU_IMAGE_FILE>
IMAGE_FILE can be in any format supported by the stb_image.c library (see the link below). 
OUTPUT_IMAGE_FILE will be created in the same format.

Dependencies:
stb_image (http://nothings.org/stb_image.c)
stb_image_write (http://nothings.org/stb/stb_image_write.h)
Google C++ Testing Framework (https://code.google.com/p/googletest/)
